This tool performs the aggregation from the peptides to the protein in several steps.\nThe first step for the labeled protein quantification is the aggregation of the differently labeled peptides. Peptides with the same sequence, modifications and\ncharge are aggregated and the ratio between the intensity from the light and heavy version is calculated.\nThe next two aggregation steps are optional. One of them is the aggregation based on charge state. Similarily to the first step, peptides with the same sequence\nand modifications, but different charge states are being aggregated.\nThe next optional step does the same for peptides with the same sequence, but different modification. Those steps build upon each other.\nThe last step is the aggregation of all peptides of a protein.\nThe result of each aggregation step is given as a tab separated file. The aggregation is performed according to the given parameters for each step.\nIf an optional aggregation is not performed, the next step takes the result from the prior aggregation.\nFor example, if aggregation by charge and modification are skipped, the protein aggregation gets a collection of peptides, where a peptidesequence can occur\nwith different charge states and midifications.\n", "releases": [{"version": "0.0.1", "distributions": [], "full_name": "bioconda/proteomiqon-labeledproteinquantification/0.0.1"}], "html_url": "http://anaconda.org/bioconda/proteomiqon-labeledproteinquantification", "builds": ["hdfd78af_0"], "watchers": 1, "dev_url": "https://github.com/CSBiology/ProteomIQon", "name": "proteomiqon-labeledproteinquantification", "license": "MIT", "versions": ["0.0.1"], "url": "http://api.anaconda.org/packages/bioconda/proteomiqon-labeledproteinquantification", "created_at": "2021-09-15 16:09:16.338000+00:00", "modified_at": "2021-09-15 16:09:19.693000+00:00", "latest_version": "0.0.1", "summary": "The tool LabeledProteinQuantification combines the results from ProteomIQon ProteinInference and ProteomIQon PSMBasedQuantification", "license_url": null, "doc_url": "https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/LabeledProteinQuantification.html"}
