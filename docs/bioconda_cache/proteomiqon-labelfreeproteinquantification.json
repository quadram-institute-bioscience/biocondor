The first two aggregation steps are optional. One of them is the\naggregation based on charge state. Peptides with the same sequence and modifications, but different charge states are being aggregated. The next optional step\ndoes the same for peptides with the same sequence, but different modifications. Those steps build upon each other. The last step is the aggregation of all\npeptides of a protein. The result of each aggregation step is given as a tab separated file. The aggregation is performed according to the given parameters for\neach step. If an optional aggregation is not performed, the next step takes the result from the prior aggregation. For example, if aggregation by charge and\nmodification are skipped, the protein aggregation is performed on previously unaggregated peptides, where a peptidesequence can occur with different charge\nstates and modifications.\n", "releases": [{"version": "0.0.1", "distributions": [], "full_name": "bioconda/proteomiqon-labelfreeproteinquantification/0.0.1"}], "html_url": "http://anaconda.org/bioconda/proteomiqon-labelfreeproteinquantification", "builds": ["hdfd78af_0"], "watchers": 1, "dev_url": "https://github.com/CSBiology/ProteomIQon", "name": "proteomiqon-labelfreeproteinquantification", "license": "MIT", "versions": ["0.0.1"], "url": "http://api.anaconda.org/packages/bioconda/proteomiqon-labelfreeproteinquantification", "created_at": "2021-09-17 16:38:48.680000+00:00", "modified_at": "2021-09-17 16:38:50.472000+00:00", "latest_version": "0.0.1", "summary": "The tool LabelFreeProteinQuantification estimates protein abundances using quantified peptide ions.", "license_url": null, "doc_url": "https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/LabelFreeProteinQuantification.html"}
