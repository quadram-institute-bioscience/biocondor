    "description": "This is an implementation of the longest run subsequence problem, introduced in (Schrinner et al., WABI 2020) https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/12795/. It describes a string problem, which looks for the longest subsequence of a string such that this sequence contains at most one consecutive run for each character in the underlying alphabet. The code contains two different algorithms (based on Integer Linear Programming and on Dynamic Programming) as described in the publication. The problem appears in the context of homology-based scaffolding of two contig sets, originating from two individuals of the same species.",
