    "description": "M-PARTY takes an input FASTA file with a variable number of aminoacidic\nsequences and performes a search against an considerable amount of Hidden\nMarkov Models, previously built and trained from state of the art plastic\n(PE - polyethylene) degrading enzymes. This process relies on the hmmsearch\nfunction from HMMER to perform the structural annotation. Output deduces\nabout the potential presence of plastic degradring enzymes in the inputed\nsequences, and is composed by 3 distinct files, in order to help the user\nto have an easier time to read and conclude about the results.\n",
